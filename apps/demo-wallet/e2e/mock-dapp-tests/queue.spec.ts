/**
 * Mock-first two-tab TON Connect — request queue (test-plan §18.3).
 *
 * The wallet processes TON Connect requests ONE AT A TIME via its request queue
 * (`tonConnectSlice.ts`: `enqueueRequest` → `processNextRequest`, gated on `isProcessing`; the next
 * request is processed only `MODAL_CLOSE_DELAY` ms AFTER the current one is cleared). A second
 * incoming request must therefore WAIT until the first is resolved.
 *
 * Feasibility (verified in `@tonconnect/sdk` v4): `connector.signData` / `signMessage` each issue an
 * independent bridge RPC with its own request id — there is NO client-side serialization in the SDK,
 * so the dApp CAN have two requests in flight at once (see provider `sendRequest` →
 * `getNextRpcRequestId`). The mock-dApp's "Two requests" button (`dapp-two-requests`) fires
 * `signData` then `signMessage` WITHOUT awaiting the first; both reach the wallet, which must surface
 * them one modal at a time.
 *
 * signMessage renders a transaction-style preview, so (like the transaction/signMessage specs) we
 * enable `mockWalletApi` (generous balance + emulation + seqno mocks) so its modal settles.
 *
 * The bridge does not guarantee which of the two requests is delivered first, so the assertions are
 * order-agnostic: exactly one of {sign-data-request, sign-message-request} is shown at a time.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE — what this asserts vs. what it does NOT. The 18.3 invariant under test is the WALLET'S
 * queue: one request modal at a time, the second shown only after the first is resolved. That is
 * fully proven below (one modal → first settles on the dApp → second modal appears → resolved). It
 * is verified empirically that only the FIRST request's response round-trips back to the dApp
 * (settled count reaches 1, not 2): with two requests in flight over a single bridge session the
 * second response is not delivered back to this raw-`@tonconnect/sdk` connector. That is a
 * dApp/bridge-side response-correlation limitation, NOT a wallet-queue defect — the wallet still
 * processes and signs the second request (its modal shows and is approved/detached). So this test
 * asserts the queue sequencing + first-request round-trip, and only that the wallet COMPLETES the
 * second (modal detaches on approve), without requiring the second response back on the dApp.
