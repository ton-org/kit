/**
 * Reduce a page of account transactions into per-transaction net outgoing-spend
 * for `walletAddress`, parsing jetton transfers directly from message bodies
 * (`getAccountTransactions` carries the raw messages, where `getEvents` returned
 * pre-decoded — but unreliable and capped — trace actions).
 *
 * - TON: per transaction, `net = sum(out-message values) - in-message value`, and
 *   only positive net is recorded. For an operator-signed agentic send the trigger
 *   is an external message (value 0), so net equals the gross outflow — the same
 *   amount the pending-spend estimate meters. The subtraction only bites when one
 *   transaction both receives an internal credit and forwards funds (a contract
 *   call metered at its net cost, e.g. receive 0.1 then send 1 counts as 0.9), and
 *   it accounts for the forward/gas TON attached to a jetton-transfer message.
 *   A send that later bounces is not refunded here: its outflow stays counted until
 *   the rolling window rolls past it (conservative — it over-blocks, never bypasses).
 * - Jettons: every out-message carrying a TEP-74 transfer/burn op yields a probe
 *   (amount + jetton-wallet address); the service resolves the wallet to a master
 *   and aggregates. Incoming jettons arrive as transfer-notifications, never as a
 *   transfer/burn op, so they are not picked up here.
 *
 * Transactions whose compute phase explicitly failed are skipped; their actions
 * were reverted and moved no funds.
