# @ton/mcp - TON MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for TON blockchain wallet operations. Built on top of `@ton/walletkit`.

## Features

- **Balance Queries**: Check TON and Jetton balances, view transaction history.
- **Transfers**: Send TON, Jettons, and NFTs to any address.
- **Swaps**: Get quotes for token swaps via DEX aggregators.
- **NFTs**: List, inspect, and transfer NFTs.
- **DNS**: Resolve TON DNS-compatible domains and reverse-lookup addresses.
- **TonProof Authentication**: Generate signed TonConnect proof-of-ownership payloads for third-party services.
- **Known Jettons**: Built-in directory of popular tokens.
- **Agentic Wallets**: Manage agentic wallets. Create, import, or manage your agentic wallets.
- **Multiple Transports**: Stdio (default), multi-session HTTP server, and serverless modes.

## Quick Start

`@ton/mcp` supports two runtime modes.

- **Agentic Wallets mode**: Server starts from local config registry at `~/.config/ton/config.json` or `TON_CONFIG_PATH`
- **Single-wallet mode**: if `MNEMONIC` or `PRIVATE_KEY` is set, the server starts with one in-memory wallet

Choose one control path per task: either run `@ton/mcp` as an MCP server (stdio or HTTP) or call tools through raw CLI. Agents must not mix MCP server mode and raw CLI against the same workflow/session, because that creates competing control paths over the same wallet/config state.

### Agentic Wallets mode

Self-custody wallets for autonomous agents. Your AI agent gets TON wallet capabilities — transfers, swaps, NFTs. User keeps the master key, agent keeps the operator key.

Key storage in this mode: wallet secrets are persisted inside the local config registry at `TON_CONFIG_PATH` or `~/.config/ton/config.json`. The config directory is created with `0700` permissions and the config file with `0600` permissions. The file is not stored as plain text, but the current protected-file format is only obfuscation-in-file, not real cryptographic protection with an external secret or password.

**Learn more about [Agentic Wallets](https://agents.ton.org/).**

Agentic Wallets mode is the default mode that allows you to manage agentic wallets. To create your first agentic wallet, ask your agent to `create agentic wallet` and follow the instructions.

```bash
# Install skills (recommended)
npx skills add ton-connect/kit/packages/mcp

# Run as stdio MCP server in agentic mode
npx @ton/mcp@alpha

# Run as HTTP server in agentic mode
npx @ton/mcp@alpha --http

# Run in registry mode with a custom config path
TON_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.json npx @ton/mcp@alpha
```

### Single-wallet mode

Single-wallet mode is a mode where the server starts with one in-memory wallet. This mode is useful when you want to manage a single wallet or when you want to use the server for a one-off task.

Key storage in this mode: `MNEMONIC` / `PRIVATE_KEY` are read from environment variables and used only in memory for the current process; `@ton/mcp` does not persist them to disk in this mode. The values come in as plain environment variables, so any non-plain-text storage or encryption is the responsibility of the caller or host environment, not `@ton/mcp`.

```bash
# Run as stdio MCP server with mnemonic
MNEMONIC="word1 word2 ..." npx @ton/mcp@alpha

# Run as HTTP server (port 3000)
MNEMONIC="word1 word2 ..." npx @ton/mcp@alpha --http

# Run as HTTP server on custom port and private key
PRIVATE_KEY="0xyour_private_key" npx @ton/mcp@alpha --http 8080
```

## Usage with MCP Clients

### Claude Desktop / Cursor

Agentic Wallets mode:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ton": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ton/mcp@alpha"],
      "env": {
        "// optional config path": "",
        "TON_CONFIG_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/config.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Single-wallet mode:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ton": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ton/mcp@alpha"],
      "env": {
        "MNEMONIC": "word1 word2 word3 ...",
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "0xyour_private_key_here (optional, alternative to MNEMONIC)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP mode

Start the server and point your MCP client to the endpoint:

```bash
npx @ton/mcp@alpha --http 3000
# MCP endpoint: http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

HTTP mode keeps a separate MCP session/transport per client session id, so multiple clients can initialize and reconnect independently.

#### `back_resolve_dns`
Reverse-resolve a TON wallet address to its associated DNS domain when available.

**Parameters:**
- `address` (required): TON wallet address to reverse resolve

### Authentication

#### `generate_ton_proof`
Generate a signed TonConnect proof-of-ownership payload for the active wallet. Use it to authenticate with third-party services that accept TonProof, such as APIs that ask for a domain and challenge payload.

**Parameters:**
- `domain` (required): Domain to generate the proof for (for example, `"getgems.io"`)
- `payload` (required): Challenge or payload string provided by the verifying service

**Returns:** Address, chain id, wallet state init, public key, timestamp, domain, payload, and base64 signature ready to submit to the verifying service.

TonProof does not broadcast a transaction, but it does require signing access to the selected wallet. Imported read-only agentic wallets need operator key rotation completed before this tool can generate a proof.

### Utility

#### `get_known_jettons`
Get a list of known/popular Jettons on TON with their addresses and metadata. Useful for looking up token addresses for swaps or transfers.

#### `agentic_validate_wallet` (registry mode only)
Validate an existing agentic wallet address against the expected network and collection.

**Parameters:**
- `address` (required): Agentic wallet address
- `network` (optional): Network to validate against
- `collectionAddress` (optional): Collection address override
- `ownerAddress` (optional): Expected owner address

#### `agentic_list_wallets_by_owner` (registry mode only)
List agentic wallets owned by a given main wallet address.

**Parameters:**
- `ownerAddress` (required): Owner wallet address
- `network` (optional): Network to query

#### `agentic_import_wallet` (registry mode only)
Import an existing agentic wallet into the local TON config registry, recovering a matching pending key draft when available. Otherwise the wallet is imported read-only until `agentic_rotate_operator_key` is completed.

**Parameters:**
- `address` (required): Agentic wallet address
- `network` (optional): Network to validate against
- `name` (optional): Wallet display name

#### `agentic_start_root_wallet_setup` (registry mode only)
Start first-root-agent setup: generate operator keys, persist a pending draft, and return a dashboard URL for the user to create the wallet from their main wallet. Agents with local shell/browser access should open the dashboard URL for the user. Callback-based completion is for long-lived stdio/HTTP server sessions; raw CLI should use manual completion.

**Parameters:**
- `network` (optional): Network for the new root wallet
- `name` (optional): Agent display name
- `source` (optional): Source or description
- `collectionAddress` (optional): Collection address override
- `tonDeposit` (optional): TON deposit hint for the dashboard

Pending onboarding callback state is persisted in the local config, so the setup can be resumed after MCP transport restarts. In HTTP mode, callback URLs are stable on the MCP server base URL. In stdio mode, use `AGENTIC_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` and/or `AGENTIC_CALLBACK_PORT` if you need a fixed callback endpoint across restarts.

#### `agentic_list_pending_root_wallet_setups` (registry mode only)
List pending root-agent onboarding drafts and their callback/session status.

#### `agentic_get_root_wallet_setup` (registry mode only)
Get one pending root-agent onboarding draft by setup id.

**Parameters:**
- `setupId` (required): Pending setup identifier

#### `agentic_complete_root_wallet_setup` (registry mode only)
Complete root-agent onboarding from callback payload or manually supplied wallet address, then import the resulting wallet and make it active.

**Parameters:**
- `setupId` (required): Pending setup identifier
- `walletAddress` (optional): Manual wallet address if no callback was received
- `ownerAddress` (optional): Owner address hint for validation

#### `agentic_cancel_root_wallet_setup` (registry mode only)
Cancel a pending root-agent onboarding draft and remove its pending state.

**Parameters:**
- `setupId` (required): Pending setup identifier

## Serverless Deployment

The package exports a `@ton/mcp/serverless` entry point for deploying as a serverless function (AWS Lambda, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, etc.). Credentials are passed via request headers instead of environment variables.

By design, serverless mode:

- operates in single-wallet mode only
- does not use the wallet registry
- does not expose wallet management and onboarding tools
- uses standard `v5r1` wallet type

### Headers

| Header          | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `MNEMONIC`      | 24-word mnemonic phrase                                  |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`   | Hex-encoded private key: 32-byte seed or 64-byte (takes priority over `MNEMONIC`) |
| `NETWORK`       | `mainnet` (default) or `testnet`                         |
| `TONCENTER_KEY` | Optional TonCenter API key for higher rate limits        |

### AWS Lambda

```typescript
import { createServerlessHandler } from '@ton/mcp/serverless';

export const handler = createServerlessHandler();
```

### Vercel

```typescript
import { createServerlessHandler } from '@ton/mcp/serverless';

export default createServerlessHandler();
```

### Custom Integration

```typescript
import { createServerlessHandler } from '@ton/mcp/serverless';

const handle = createServerlessHandler();

const response = await handle({
  method: 'POST',
  url: '/mcp',
  headers: {
    'MNEMONIC': 'word1 word2 word3 ...',
    'NETWORK': 'mainnet',
  },
  body: mcpRequestBody,
});
```

## Development

```bash
# Run from source (stdio)
pnpm --filter @ton/mcp dev:cli

# Run from source (HTTP)
pnpm --filter @ton/mcp dev:cli:http

# Build
pnpm --filter @ton/mcp build

# Checks
pnpm --filter @ton/mcp test
pnpm --filter @ton/mcp typecheck

# Run built version
node packages/mcp/dist/cli.js
node packages/mcp/dist/cli.js --http 8080
```

## Library Usage

The package also exports a programmatic API for building custom MCP servers:

```typescript
import { createTonWalletMCP } from '@ton/mcp';
import { Signer, WalletV5R1Adapter, TonWalletKit, MemoryStorageAdapter, Network } from '@ton/walletkit';

// Initialize TonWalletKit
const network = Network.mainnet();
const kit = new TonWalletKit({
  networks: { [network.chainId]: {} },
  storage: new MemoryStorageAdapter(),
});
await kit.waitForReady();

// Create wallet from mnemonic
const signer = await Signer.fromMnemonic(mnemonic, { type: 'ton' });
const walletAdapter = await WalletV5R1Adapter.create(signer, {
  client: kit.getApiClient(network),
  network,
});
const wallet = await kit.addWallet(walletAdapter);

// Create MCP server
const server = await createTonWalletMCP({ wallet });
```

The same factory also supports registry mode:

```typescript
import { createTonWalletMCP } from '@ton/mcp';

const server = await createTonWalletMCP({
  networks: {
    mainnet: { apiKey: process.env.TONCENTER_API_KEY },
  },
});
```
