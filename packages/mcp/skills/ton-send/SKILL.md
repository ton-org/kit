# Send TON & Tokens

Transfer TON or jettons to any address. Supports TON DNS resolution for `.ton` and `.t.me` domains.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Required | Optional |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| `build_ton_transfer` | `toAddress`, `amount` | `comment`, `walletSelector` |
| `build_jetton_transfer` | `toAddress`, `jettonAddress`, `amount` | `comment`, `walletSelector` |
| `emulate_transaction` | `messages` | `validUntil` |
| `send_raw_transaction` | `messages` | `validUntil`, `fromAddress`, `walletSelector` |
| `resolve_dns` | `domain` | — |
| `back_resolve_dns` | `address` | — |

`build_ton_transfer` and `build_jetton_transfer` do NOT broadcast — they return ready-to-send `transaction.messages` plus `transaction.fromAddress`. Preview with `emulate_transaction`, then broadcast with `send_raw_transaction`.

## Workflows

### Send TON
1. If the user provides a DNS name (e.g., `foundation.ton`, `user.t.me`) instead of a raw address, call `resolve_dns` first
2. Call `build_ton_transfer` with address and amount to build the transaction (it is NOT sent)
3. Preview it with `emulate_transaction` using the returned `transaction.messages` (recommended before broadcasting)
4. Ask one short yes/no confirmation that restates the amount and recipient
5. Broadcast with `send_raw_transaction` passing the `transaction.messages` and `transaction.fromAddress`
6. Poll `get_transaction_status` with the returned `normalizedHash` until status is `completed` or `failed` (see `ton-balance` skill). User can ask to skip polling.

### Send Jetton (Token)
1. If user mentions a token by name, call `get_known_jettons` (see `ton-balance` skill) to find the `jettonAddress`
2. Call `get_jetton_balance` to verify sufficient balance
3. Call `build_jetton_transfer` with the `jettonAddress`, `toAddress`, and `amount` to build the transaction (it is NOT sent)
4. Preview it with `emulate_transaction` using the returned `transaction.messages` (recommended before broadcasting)
5. Ask one short yes/no confirmation before sending
6. Broadcast with `send_raw_transaction` passing the `transaction.messages` and `transaction.fromAddress` (jetton messages target the sender's jetton wallet)
7. Poll `get_transaction_status` until completed or failed

## Notes

- Amounts are human-readable (e.g., `"1.5"` = 1.5 TON, `"100"` = 100 tokens)
- `build_ton_transfer`/`build_jetton_transfer` build the transaction only; `send_raw_transaction` is the tool that actually signs and broadcasts
- Use `emulate_transaction` to preview expected balance changes before broadcasting (fake signature)
- Always confirm with the user before broadcasting a transfer; prefer the host client's structured confirmation UI when available, otherwise accept natural-language yes/no and do not require a fixed confirmation phrase
- After broadcasting, poll `get_transaction_status` by default. User can specify whether to check status.
- If no wallet is configured, use the `ton-create-wallet` skill first
