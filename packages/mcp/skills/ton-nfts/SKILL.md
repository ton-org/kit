# TON NFT Operations

View and transfer NFTs on the TON blockchain.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Required | Optional |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| `get_nfts` | — | `limit`, `offset`, `walletSelector` |
| `get_nfts_by_address` | `address` | `limit`, `offset` |
| `get_nft` | `nftAddress` | — |
| `send_nft` | `nftAddress`, `toAddress` | `comment`, `broadcast`, `walletSelector` |
| `emulate_transaction` | `messages` | `validUntil` |

## Workflows

### List My NFTs
1. Call `get_nfts` to list NFTs in the active wallet
2. Use `limit` and `offset` for pagination

### View NFT Details
1. Call `get_nft` with the `nftAddress`

### Send an NFT
1. Call `get_nfts` to find the NFT address if the user doesn't have it
2. Ask one short yes/no confirmation before transferring the NFT
3. Call `send_nft` with `nftAddress` and `toAddress`
4. Poll `get_transaction_status` with the returned `normalizedHash` until status is `completed` or `failed` (see `ton-balance` skill)

## Notes

- Use `emulate_transaction` to preview expected balance changes before sending (fake signature)
- Use `broadcast: false` on `send_nft` when you need a real signed BoC without broadcasting; do not poll `get_transaction_status` until the BoC is sent separately
- Always confirm with the user before transferring an NFT; prefer the host client's structured confirmation UI when available, otherwise accept natural-language yes/no and do not require a fixed confirmation phrase
- If no wallet is configured, use the `ton-create-wallet` skill first
