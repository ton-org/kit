# Usage Examples

These examples show how `@ton/mcp` can be used in raw CLI mode. They are illustrative rather than literal agent logs: each example includes a representative user request, the `npx @ton/mcp@alpha` commands an agent would typically run, and the kind of response it would usually return.
